Project Introduction
Lightweight fine-tuning is one of the most important techniques for adapting foundation models, because it allows you to modify foundation models for your needs without needing substantial computational resources.

**Project Summary
In this project, you will bring together all of the essential components of a PyTorch + Hugging Face training and inference process. Specifically, you will:

Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model
Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model**

1. Prepare the Foundation Model
   - Load a pretrained HF model
   - Load and preprocess a dataset
   - Evaluate the pretrained model

2. Perform Lightweight Fine-Tuning
   - Create a PEFT model
   - Train the PEFT model
   - Save the PEFT model
  
3. Perform Inference Using the Fine-Tuned Model
   - Load the saved PEFT model
   - Evaluate the fine-tuned model
